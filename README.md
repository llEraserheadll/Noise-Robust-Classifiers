# LabelShield

**LabelShield** is a robust machine learning framework designed for classification tasks using a diverse set of algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Bagging ensembles. This multi-model strategy allows for flexible experimentation and provides insights into which algorithm suits your dataset best.

## üß† Model Architectures & Under-the-Hood Insights

### 1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- **Codebase**: [`svm.py`](./svm.py)
- **Library Used**: `scikit-learn`
- **Core Idea**: SVM tries to find the best hyperplane that separates classes with the **maximum margin**.

#### How It Works
- Maps input data into a high-dimensional space using **kernel tricks** (e.g., RBF).
- Finds a decision boundary (hyperplane) that **maximizes the distance** to the nearest data points (support vectors).
- Great at handling **linearly and non-linearly separable data**.

#### Pros
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- Works well on small to medium datasets.
- Excellent theoretical foundation.

#### Cons
- Not ideal for large datasets (training time scales poorly).
- Harder to tune for multi-class problems.

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- **Codebase**: [`CNN.py`](./CNN.py)
- **Library Used**: `PyTorch`
- **Core Idea**: CNNs are inspired by the human visual system and excel at extracting spatial hierarchies in data (images, audio spectrograms, etc.).

#### How It Works
- Uses **convolutional layers** to scan for patterns in local regions of the input.
- **Pooling layers** reduce dimensionality and retain key information.
- **Fully connected layers** at the end make final predictions.

#### Highlights from Your Code
- The model uses:
  - `Conv2d` ‚Üí `ReLU` ‚Üí `MaxPool2d` stack
  - Flattened layer followed by `Linear` (FC) layer
- Training loop includes loss computation (`CrossEntropyLoss`) and backpropagation using `Adam` optimizer.

#### Pros
- State-of-the-art performance in image classification.
- Learns hierarchical features automatically.
- Scales well with larger datasets.

#### Cons
- Requires more data and compute.
- Longer training time than classical ML models.

### 3. Bagging Classifier (Bootstrap Aggregating)

- **Codebase**: [`Bagging.py`](./Bagging.py)
- **Library Used**: `scikit-learn`
- **Core Idea**: Bagging combines multiple weak learners (often decision trees) trained on random subsets of the data to reduce variance and prevent overfitting.

#### How It Works
- Trains multiple base classifiers (e.g., Decision Trees) on **randomly sampled data** with replacement.
- Final prediction is made via **majority voting** (classification) or **averaging** (regression).
- Improves stability and accuracy of models.

#### Pros
- Reduces overfitting.
- Performs well on noisy datasets.
- Simple to implement and parallelize.

#### Cons
- Less interpretable than single models.
- Doesn‚Äôt perform feature selection.

## üîç Model Comparison

| Feature                | SVM                      | CNN                             | Bagging                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Best For               | Small tabular datasets   | Image / spatial data            | Noisy / tabular data             |
| Learning Style         | Discriminative           | Feature learning via layers     | Ensemble of base learners        |
| Interpretability       | Moderate                 | Low (black-box)                 | Low (ensemble of trees)          |
| Speed (Training)       | Fast (small data)        | Slower (needs GPU)              | Medium (parallelizable)          |
| Generalization         | Strong margin theory     | Strong with enough data         | Strong (reduced variance)        |

## ü•á Which is Superior?

There‚Äôs **no one-size-fits-all**:

- **CNN** is ideal for visual/spatial patterns (e.g., images, spectrograms).
- **SVM** shines with **well-separated, small datasets**.
- **Bagging** is robust and performs well with **unstable base models** and **noisy data**.

Use **cross-validation** and **performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC)** to empirically decide.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

Each model script is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
# Run SVM
python svm.py

# Run CNN
python CNN.py

# Run Bagging Classifier
python Bagging.py
```

Make sure to have dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn torch torchvision
```

## üìà Future Work

- Add evaluation metrics comparison (confusion matrix, F1 score, etc.)
- Integrate all models under a unified training/evaluation framework.
- Add dataset loading hooks and preprocessing pipelines.
